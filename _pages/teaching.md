<div class="wordwrap">Teaching and mentoring at KU has been a gratifying experience, enabling me to positively influence students in their academic pursuits. My vision of teaching is to inspire the curiosities of students during classroom teaching. The primary subjects I have been teaching at KU are data science and fundamental algorithms. You can find all the course schedules on <a href="https://canvas.ku.edu">Canvas</a>.</div>
